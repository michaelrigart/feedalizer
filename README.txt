= Feedalizer

http://termos.vemod.net/feedalizer

== Description

Feedalizer is a *small* Ruby library that glues together Hpricot with the
standard RSS library in a way that makes it easy to transform web pages into
RSS feeds. If you ask me, it makes it *too* easy.

== Documentation

First of all, see the included examples and take a quick look at the code.

Then read some documentation for the two libraries that are used:

* Hpricot:
  http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/
* RSS::Maker:
