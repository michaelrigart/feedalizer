# Feedalizer

Feedalizer is a *small* Ruby library that glues together Hpricot with the standard RSS library in a way that makes it easy to transform web pages into RSS feeds. If you ask me, it makes it *too* easy.

This gem was originally created by [Christoffer Sawicki](http://qerub.se/feedalizer) who made the last version 0.1.2. During my search for a way to convert web pages to RSS feeds, I came upon this Gem and decided to revive it again.

I'm currently still waiting for author approval on RubyGems.org. If I don't hear back from Christoffer, I'll re-release the gem under a new name.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'feedalizer', git: 'git://github.com/michaelrigart/feedalizer.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

<!---
Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install feedalizer
--->

## Usage

First of all, see the included examples and take a quick look at the code.

## Development
